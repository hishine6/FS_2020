 SOGANG_UNIV_FILE_SYSTEM_2020_PROJECT 1~3

Goal: build a system to process, maintain the information about Customers, Game, purchase  
While this project's main goal was to know what happens to records, indices of a basic file system, it really didn't teach us much. Because the main, big effort needed to complete this project was to better understand the language 'C++'. Still, It gave us a chance to look into and really struggle with 'worst, best, first fit algorithm', 'fixed, variable lenght records', 'Using B-Tree index', etc.

# Project 1
--> Set the basic class members, methods of Customer, Game, Purchase  
--> Create a code that makes the .dat file

# Project 2
--> Set a UI that can make the user available to search, add, delete, change the information of .dat file  
--> add a index file(.ind), which is automatically updated

# Project 3
--> Use the BTree to create a index file
--> all the searching process should be done by the BTree
